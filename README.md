# interviewCode

ðŸ”¹ 1. Core Concepts

Execution Context & Call Stack â†’ how JS code runs step by step.

Hoisting â†’ what happens with var, let, const, and function declarations.

Closures â†’ function + lexical scope (classic interview topic).

Scopes â†’ global, function, block scope, var vs let vs const.

this keyword â†’ how this changes in functions, objects, classes, arrow functions.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Asynchronous JS

Event Loop â†’ call stack, microtasks vs macrotasks, Node.js phases.

Promises â†’ states, chaining, error handling.

async/await â†’ syntax, error handling with try/catch, sequential vs parallel execution.

Callbacks vs Promises vs async/await â†’ when to use each.

process.nextTick vs Promise vs setTimeout in Node.js.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Objects & Functions

Prototypes & Inheritance â†’ prototype chain, Object.create, class syntax.

Higher-order functions â†’ map, filter, reduce.

Pure functions & immutability â†’ functional programming basics.

Currying & Partial Application â†’ common in interviews.

Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE).

ðŸ”¹ 4. Advanced Topics

Event delegation â†’ bubbling, capturing.

Debounce & Throttle â†’ performance patterns.

Modules â†’ CommonJS (require) vs ES Modules (import/export).

Error handling â†’ try/catch/finally, custom errors.

Memory leaks in JS â†’ closures, event listeners, timers.

ðŸ”¹ 5. ES6+ Features

Destructuring â†’ arrays, objects.

Rest & Spread operators.

Template literals.

Default parameters.

Optional chaining (?.) & Nullish coalescing (??).

Generators & Iterators â†’ function*, yield.

Symbol & WeakMap/WeakSet.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Data Structures in JS

Array methods â†’ map, reduce, forEach, find, some, every.

Set & Map â†’ differences vs arrays/objects.

WeakMap & WeakSet â†’ memory management.

ðŸ”¹ 7. DOM & Browser APIs (if full-stack role)

DOM manipulation â†’ querySelector, append, remove.

Event handling â†’ addEventListener, event bubbling/capturing.

LocalStorage vs SessionStorage vs Cookies.

fetch API & XMLHttpRequest.

ðŸ”¹ 8. Node.js-Specific

Event Loop phases in Node.

process.nextTick vs setImmediate.

Modules in Node (CommonJS vs ESM).

Streams & Buffers.

Cluster & Worker Threads.

libuv & thread pool.
